# Convertable
A simple converter mobile application written in React Native and using API from apilayer.
This application can convert currency, measure and mass.
<br />
In this project, I'm using:
- React Native - of course
- Redux - to manage my state (a simple and just for practice)
- Big.js - to handle the floating point number 
- React Navigation - navigate between screens
