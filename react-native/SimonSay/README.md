# SimonSay
Simple SimonSay game (a kind of memorize game) to practice with React Native.
<br />
In this project, I'm using:
- React Native Components - yeah, I learn about how to write a React Component by making this game
- Animations - a little bit of animation to practice and make my game more interesting
- React Native Sound - sound is actually necessary for a game - I guess.
